    `rand_word(theme="tech")` with the theme already chosen; every other argument
    is the same.

    Args:
        language: Language of the generated words. `"all"` mixes every language.
        count: How many words to return. Held inside `0`..`RAND_COUNT_MAX`.
        realism: whether the word is a real one or invented to read like the
            language. `"mixed"` decides per word.
        min_length: Minimum length in characters. Defaults to what the pools hold.
        max_length: Maximum length in characters.
        starts_with: Keep only words whose first character is this one.
        unique: Never return the same word twice.
        output: `"value"` for strings, `"detail"` for a `WordDetail` each.

    Returns:
        `count` words, or a `WordDetail` for each of them.

    Example:
        >>> rand_tech(language="ko", count=3)
        ['서버', '캐시', '대역']
        >>> rand_tech(language="en", count=3)
