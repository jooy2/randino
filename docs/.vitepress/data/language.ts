/**
 * Which package the reader is here for, as one value the whole site shares.

 * `localStorage` is where the choice actually lives. Beyond that it is kept in
 * **two** places on purpose, and they are not redundant:
 *
 * - `document.documentElement.dataset.lang` is the one that displays a page.
 *   Every `::: lang` block is in the DOM and CSS hides the ones that are not
 *   wanted, so switching is a single attribute write with no re-render — and in
 *   a built site the inline script in `<head>` sets it before the first paint,
 *   so nothing flashes and there is nothing for hydration to disagree about.
 * - The `ref` here is for the parts that are components rather than content:
 *   the switch itself, which has to know which of its two options is chosen.
 *
 * `setCodeLanguage` writes all three — attribute, ref, storage — so nothing else
 * has to remember the order.
